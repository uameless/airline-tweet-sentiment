# Airline Tweet Sentiment Analysis :

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on tweets about airlines. It classifies the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral based on user opinions shared on Twitter. The project leverages machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) models, including transformer-based models, to predict sentiment and analyze customer feedback.

## Project Overview :

This project uses a dataset of airline-related tweets to predict the sentiment of each tweet. We employed multiple machine learning algorithms, including BERT, DistilBERT, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to evaluate sentiment. The goal is to identify how customers feel about airlines based on their tweets and improve customer relations.
