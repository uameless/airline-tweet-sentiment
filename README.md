# Airline Tweet Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets about airlines, classifying them as positive, negative, or neutral based on user opinions shared on Twitter. It leverages machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) models, including transformer-based models, to predict sentiment and analyze customer feedback.

## Project Details
This project utilizes a dataset of airline-related tweets to determine sentiment. We employed multiple machine learning models, including BERT, DistilBERT, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to evaluate and compare sentiment predictions. The goal is to analyze customer opinions and help improve airline services by understanding user sentiment.
